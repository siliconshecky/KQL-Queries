# KQL-Queries

A Listing of Queries that use KQL.
These queries will be for one of the following and tagged as such:
1) Azure Resource Graph - ARG
2) Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunding - MDEH
3) Microsoft Sentinel - MSEN


Azure Resource Graph Information:
You can select multiple subscriptions to run the ARG queries on. So far I have only had success getting data with them using the Contributor role for those subscriptions.


Any MDE Advanced Hunting Query you can turn into a Custom Detection in MDE. If you do, make sure to know how many false positives it generates so you do not get alert fatigue.
